The file for the CSS assignment is in the css_assignment directory.
I opted to put the CSS in the html file since it was a static file and it
may be easier to read. This normally would have been in an external file
and linked via a <style> element.

The files for the react assignment are in the react_assignment directory.
You will need to install npm, node and create-react-app. Run create-react-app
and replace the contents of the src directory with the contents of the
provided directory. Run it with `npm start`.
